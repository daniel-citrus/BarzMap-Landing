# BarzMap Landing

This repository now ships with a fresh Vite + React + Tailwind CSS setup to power the BarzMap landing page.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the URL printed in the terminal (defaults to <http://localhost:5173>).

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – launch Vite in development mode with hot module replacement.
- `npm run build` – create a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.

Tailwind is preconfigured. Add styles via utility classes or extend the design system in `tailwind.config.js` as needed.
