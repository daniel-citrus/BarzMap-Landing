## 1. Overview & Goals

**BarzMap** is a web platform that helps users find and share outdoor calisthenics parks and workout spaces. It’s designed for athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and beginners who enjoy training outdoors and want to discover new workout environments.

The **landing page** serves two main purposes:

1. **Communicate BarzMap’s value and features** clearly to visitors.  
2. **Encourage signups for the mailing list** — so users receive developer updates, early access invitations, and the official launch announcement.

**Primary conversion goal:** Mailing list subscriptions  
**Secondary goals:** Build brand awareness, validate interest, and attract early community members.

## 3. Visual Direction & Branding

### Mood & Tone

- **Energetic yet minimal.** Reflects the outdoor, movement-driven nature of calisthenics.  
- **Community-centered.** Emphasize connection, discovery, and contribution.  
- **Modern & trustworthy.** Clean UI that feels like a serious tool, not a gimmick.

###  Color Palette

| Role | Color | HEX |
|------|--------|------|
| **Primary (Deep Blue)** | ![#005A9C](https://placehold.co/15x15/005A9C/005A9C.png) | `#005A9C` |
| **Accent (Vibrant Green)** | ![#00C853](https://placehold.co/15x15/00C853/00C853.png) | `#00C853` |
| **Slate (Text/Base)** | ![#1F2933](https://placehold.co/15x15/1F2933/1F2933.png) | `#1F2933` |
| **Background Gray** | ![#F5F7FA](https://placehold.co/15x15/F5F7FA/F5F7FA.png) | `#F5F7FA` |
| **Highlight Orange (CTA hover)** | ![#FFA726](https://placehold.co/15x15/FFA726/FFA726.png) | `#FFA726` |

Color logic: deep blue delivers enough contrast for accessibility while still evoking trust and exploration, green symbolizes health and growth, orange adds energy to CTAs.

### Typography

- **Headings:** `Poppins` – Bold, geometric, approachable.  
- **Body:** `Inter` – Clean, readable, modern.  
- **Hierarchy Example:**  
  - H1: `text-5xl font-bold`  
  - H2: `text-3xl font-semibold`  
  - Paragraph: `text-base text-gray-700 leading-relaxed`

### Imagery & Iconography

- Use **real outdoor environments** (urban parks, beaches, community spaces).  
- Favor **wide shots** with natural lighting.  
- Include **diverse athletes** (men/women, different skill levels).  
- Iconography: thin-line or outline style with vibrant accent colors.

## 5. UX & Conversion Strategy

| Principle | Application |
|------------|--------------|
| **Single Primary CTA** | Email subscription is the only action; avoid distractions. |
| **Visual Hierarchy** | Bold headlines, contrasting CTA button colors, whitespace between sections. |
| **Social Proof** | Testimonials, stats, and global map visualization establish credibility. |
| **Repetition of CTA** | Include sign-up prompt in Hero, mid-page, and final section. |
| **Emotion & Aspiration** | Use copy that evokes movement, discovery, and belonging. |

---

## 6. Responsive Design Considerations

| Device | Layout Adjustment |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Desktop** | Two-column hero, multi-column feature grids, large hero imagery. |
| **Tablet** | Collapse features to single-column, ensure mailing form remains visible. |
| **Mobile** | Stacked layout; CTAs always full-width; font sizes adjusted (`text-lg` → `text-base`). |
| **Touch targets** | Buttons ≥ 44px height; ample padding for forms. |

---

## 7. Accessibility & Best Practices

- **Contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1** for all text.  
- **Alt text** for all images and icons.  
- **Keyboard navigability:** Tab focus indicators for form fields and buttons.  
- **Readable fonts:** Minimum body size `16px`.  
- **Form validation:** Clear feedback for incorrect emails.  
- **Animation preference:** Respect user `prefers-reduced-motion`.
